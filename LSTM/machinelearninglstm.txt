Machine learning models take vectors (arrays of numbers) as input. When working with text, the first thing we must do come up with a strategy to convert strings to numbers (or to "vectorize" the text) before feeding it to the model. In this section, we will look at three strategies for doing so.

One-hot encodings
As a first idea, we might "one-hot" encode each word in our vocabulary. Consider the sentence "The cat sat on the mat". The vocabulary (or unique words) in this sentence is (cat, mat, on, sat, the). To represent each word, we will create a zero vector with length equal to the vocabulary, then place a one in the index that corresponds to the word. This approach is shown in the following diagram.
